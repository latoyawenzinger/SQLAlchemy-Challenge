# SQLAlchemy-Challenge


SQLAlchemy and Python was used to query climate data from areas around Hawaii. This activity is split into 3 parts:


1. **Precipiation Analysis**
  - queries were made to find the the most recent date in the dataset, and the precipication data based on the previous 12 months


2. **Station Analysis**
  - queries were made to find the total number of stations, and the the most activate station
  - the Max, Min, and Average temperatures were queried for only the most active station


3. **Climate APP - Flask API**
4.  - static and dynamic routes were created based on previous queries
